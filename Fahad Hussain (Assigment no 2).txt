Q.1: Create two integer variables length and breadth and assign values then check if they are square values or rectangle values.
ie: if both values are equal then it's square otherwise rectangle.


   int lenght = 4 ;
  int breadth = 6;
  if(lenght == breadth){
    print("its Square");
  }
  else{
    
    print("it's rectangle");
  }
  
  
Q.3: A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%. Create integer variables and assign value:
Number of classes held = 16,
Number of classes attended = 10,
and print percentage of class attended.
Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not?


int total  = 16;
int  attandad = 10;
 double percentage = (attandad/total*100);
  num req_per = 75;
  if(percentage<req_per){
    print("he will not be allowed in Exam");
    
  }
  else{
    
    print("his Percantage is above than 75 he was able to sit in Exam");
  }

  Q.5  Write a program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature:
You have num variable temperature = 42;
Now print the message according to temperature:
temp < 0 then Freezing weather
temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
temp 10-20 then Cold weather
temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
temp 30-40 then Its Hot
temp >=40 then Its Very Hot



    num temprature = 42;
  if(temprature< 0 ){
    
    print("it's Freezing weather '0 Â°C'");
  }
     else if(temprature> 0 && temprature < 10){
      print("Very Cold weather");
      
    }
    else if(temprature>10 && temprature<20){
      print("Cold Weather");
    }
    else if(temprature>20 && temprature<30){
      print("Normal in Temprature");
 
    }
    else if(temprature>30 && temprature<40){
      print("its Hot");
    }
    else if(temprature>=40){
      print("it's very Hot Today");
      
    }

  print("Customer IDNO: $id\nCustomer Name: $name\nunits Consumed: $units");
  print("Amount Charges @Rs. 2.00 per unit : 1200.00");
  print("Net bill amount: ${units*charge}");
  
  
  Q.4: Create integer variable assign any year to it and check if a year is leap year or not.
If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.

  if(a%2==0){
    print("its leap year");
   
    
    
  }
